# Sometimes is useful to use different targets. This is because if you modify a
# single file in your project, you donâ€™t have to recompile everything, only what
# you modified.

# target 'all' has only dependencies now. For make to execute, it has to meet
# all dependencies of the called target. Each of the dependencies are searched
# and all available targets executed.

all: hello

hello: main.o factorial.o hello.o
	g++ main.o factorial.o hello.o -o hello

main.o: main.cpp
	g++ -c main.cpp

factorial.o: factorial.cpp
	g++ -c factorial.cpp

hello.o: hello.cpp
	g++ -c hello.cpp

# this target gets rid of all the object files and executables.
# run with: make -f makefile_2_dependencies clean
clean:
	rm *o hello
